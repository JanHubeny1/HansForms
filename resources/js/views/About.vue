            The main goal of this project is to create a survey web application
            for processing the survey, where users can fill in the forms, but
            also manage them. Except for basic functionality which is form
            rendering followed by the ability to answer the form, the
            application will contain for example access restrictions depending
            on the start and end date, private access for invited users, or data
            export for correlation analysis purposes.
